# Introduction

### What is Centmin Mod?

Centmin Mod is an automated LEMP stack installer for CentOS 7, AlmaLinux 8 and Rocky Linux 8 YUM/DNF package-based Linux servers.

Centmin Mod LEMP web stack auto installer takes the manual work out of the process and fully automates most of install, configuration, base optimisation and best recommended practices and settings for CentOS, Nginx, MariaDB MySQL, PHP, CSF Firewall security and other installed software. The whole process is done via the core `centmin.sh` shell based script which can install Centmin Mod via a [curl one liner install method](installation.md). Centmin Mod does not have a web gui panel but rather allows the admin/owner to manage their server(s) on the SSH command line with added convenience of a [shell based menu](shell\_menu.md) for commonly performed tasks.
